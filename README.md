# Teeterpogger v1.0- Simple Dice Roller for TTRPGs

**Teeterpogger**: *Noun* : Phonetic version of TTRPGer, i.e. someone who plays TTRPGs.
This program is a simple dice-roller made with Python and a PyQT6 GUI, designed to be used for Table-Top Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs for short).

## Features

- Cross-platform dice support for a range of TTRPG systems, including D20 systems (like D&D and Pathfinder), Fate, and DCC with an extended set of dice from d3 to d30 and percentile dice
- Support for two different modifier types: per roll and per die
- History feature to keep track of the rolls in your current session
- Parchment-themed UI for an immersive experience

## Instructions to run

- Ensure Python 3 is installed and set up on the system. This project was built with Python 3.14.0a5 which was the latest version of Python during development, so it should be backwards compatible with earlier Python 3 versions as well.
- Clone this repo locally
- Install all the requirements by running <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
- Run the program with the command <code>python dice_roller_gui.py</code> in the project folder.
